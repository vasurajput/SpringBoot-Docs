#POD
====
1- For Creating a Pod using command
kubectl run firstpod  --generator=run-pod/v1 --image=nginx

2- To List all pods
kubectl get pod/po/pods

# To List all Nodes
kubectl get nodes/no/node

# To see all details of pod
kubectl get pods -o wide
kubectl get pods -o json
kubectl get pods -o yaml

# Suppose if you don't know anything about pods so you can see the documentation with below command
kubectl explain pods

# To see the all step to create a pod use below command
kubectl describe pod your-pod-name

# To watch a pod means continously check what a pod is doing means if some delete then it will automatically create it so to watch this activity 
kubectl get pods -w

#To Delete a POD
kubectl delete pod firstpod

# Label a POD
First you can check the label assing to a POD using
   kubectl describe pod firstpod command
and after that to assign a new label to the pod use below command
   kubectl label pod firstpod env=testing
Now Suppose we want to override/update the label value say env=dev then if you use the ablove command you will get error overwrite not allowed so use the below command
   kubectl label --overwrite pod firstpod env=dev
Now if you want to delete any specific label then just use - in front of that label key. For example see the below command to delete the env label
   kubectl label pod firstpod env-
Suppose if you want to assign a label to all the pods then use the below command
   kubectl label --all pods status=xyz
   kubectl label --all pods status-      // This is used to remove this status label from all the pods
