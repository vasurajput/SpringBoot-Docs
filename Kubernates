#POD
====
1- For Creating a Pod using command
kubectl run firstpod  --generator=run-pod/v1 --image=nginx

2- To List all pods
kubectl get pod/po/pods

# To List all Nodes
kubectl get nodes/no/node

# To see all details of pod
kubectl get pods -o wide
kubectl get pods -o json
kubectl get pods -o yaml

# Suppose if you don't know anything about pods so you can see the documentation with below command
kubectl explain pods

# To see the all step to create a pod use below command
kubectl describe pod your-pod-name

# To watch a pod means continously check what a pod is doing means if some delete then it will automatically create it so to watch this activity 
kubectl get pods -w

#To Delete a POD
kubectl delete pod firstpod

# Label a POD
First you can check the label assing to a POD using
   kubectl describe pod firstpod command
and after that to assign a new label to the pod use below command
   kubectl label pod firstpod env=testing
Now Suppose we want to override/update the label value say env=dev then if you use the ablove command you will get error overwrite not allowed so use the below command
   kubectl label --overwrite pod firstpod env=dev
Now if you want to delete any specific label then just use - in front of that label key. For example see the below command to delete the env label
   kubectl label pod firstpod env-
Suppose if you want to assign a label to all the pods then use the below command
   kubectl label --all pods status=xyz
   kubectl label --all pods status-      // This is used to remove this status label from all the pods
To See/List all the labels use below command
   kubectl get pods --show-labels
   
   
# Create a POD using yaml File. So for this create a yaml file and paste the below details there and then run the below command

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: vasupod
  labels:
    env: prod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: firstcustomcontainer
      image: nginx
 
after saving above file use the below command to create the POD from this yaml file.
    kubectl create -f mycustompod.yaml
    
# To see the complete syntax and format of this pod yaml file use the below command
    kubectl explain pods --recursive
    kubectl explain pods --recursive | less
    
# To edit a POD yaml file use the below command
    kubectl edit pod firstpod
    
# Set and See the environment variable in the POD yaml file
  First edit your yaml file
  
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: vasupod
  labels:
    env: prod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: firstcustomcontainer
      image: nginx
      env:
        - name: myname
          value: vasu
        - name: city
          value: Najibabad
          
 Now to see this envirnment variable run the below command
    kubectl exec vasupod env
